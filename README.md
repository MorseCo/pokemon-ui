# Pokemon UI

Run this UI alongside the pokemonAPI. There are two versions of the UI separated by branches. The first version `master` does not use authentication, and thus should be used with the base `pokemonAPI.py` API. The second version `authentication` should be used with the other two versions of the pokemonAPI. This version will add authentication to your API calls. 

Assuming you have angular installed, run `ng serve` to run this UI.
